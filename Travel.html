    <h2>Cardiff</h2>
    <p class="round1">I stay in Penarth, Cardiff multiple times per year when visiting my grandparents. Since I was very young, 
        Cardiff has been one of my favourite places to visit and holds many memories for me. Cardiff Bay is in my opinion 
        one of the most beautiful spots in the world. Penarth itself is a small picturesque seaside town where we spend most
        of our time when we visit. </p>

<h2>Girona</h2>
    <p class="round1">In 2016, I spent two weeks in L'Estartit,a holiday town a few miles from Girona. It was a fantastic place 
        to make new friends and enjoy the sun. While there we visited many Roman ruins in the area as well as older Iberian settlements.
        The city of Girona is most definitely worth a visit with a beautiful Jewish quarter and old Medieval walls. It is also the setting
        for many scenes of the TV show Game of Thrones.

 <h2>Ios</h2>
    <p class="round1">This summer a group of friends and I will be visiting Ios in Greece for two weeks.Ios is a hilly island with cliffs 
       down to the sea on most sides, situated halfway between Naxos and Santorini. Chora (the main village)  is full of stairs 
       and narrow paths that make it inaccessible for cars of any kind. Today, the main path through this village is completely taken over
       by tourism in terms of restaurants, boutiques, bars and discoth√®ques. Apart from the port and the village of Chora, Ios has a few 
       small settlements, just a group of spread out houses in the background of major beaches (Theodoti, Kalamos, Manganari).
