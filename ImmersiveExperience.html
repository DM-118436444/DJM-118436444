    <h2>Immersive Experience</h2>
    <p class="one">Immersion into virtual reality is a perception of being physically present
        in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR 
        system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment. </p>
   
    <p class="two">VR places extreme requirements on several dimensions of visual quality, sound quality,
        and intuitive interactions. For example, high pixel quality and quantity is needed since the screen is so close to the eyes.
        Realistic 3D positional audio is needed so the sound is accurate to the real world. And interfaces need to be so intuitive and responsive that they disappear.
        By focusing on all these dimensions, a fully immersive experience can be achieved.</p>
